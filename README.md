# Eduflex-Assignment-tool-homework
A simple script to call my homework(not yours) from Eduflex and upload it to a database
Due to the fact that the author is not as "fluent" in python as required, you will have to make a few changes to this code.
Where ever you see "<enter something>" you must remove the "<>" and enter the information asked as a string and then save.
You will then have to run setup.py manually

Caution! Proceed your own risk! Any Damages caused by the script: 1) On your Computer 2)On your Eduflex Account 3) Any other Machines or Computers used midway is at your own expense and not the author's.
